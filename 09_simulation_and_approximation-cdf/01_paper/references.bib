abstract = {We consider a nonstationary vector autoregressive process which is integrated of order 1, and generated by i.i.d. Gaussian errors. We then derive the maximum likelihood estimator of the space of cointegration vectors and the likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that it has a given number of dimensions. Further we test linear hypotheses about the cointegration vectors. The asymptotic distribution of these test statistics are found and the first is described by a natural multivariate version of the usual test for unit root in an autoregressive process, and the other is a χ2 test.}

abstract = {A new test is proposed for cointegration in a single‐equation framework where the regressors are weakly exogenous for the parameters of interest. The test is denoted as an error‐correction mechanism (ECM) test and is based upon the ordinary least squares coefficient of the lagged dependent variable in an autoregressive distributed lag model augmented with leads of the regressors. The limit distributions of the standardized coeffi cient and t‐ratio versions of the ECM tests are obtained and critical values are provided. These limit distributions do not depend upon nuisance parameters but they depend on the number of regressors. Finally, we compare their power properties with those of other cointegration tests available in the literature and find the circumstances under which the ECM tests have a better performance.},
