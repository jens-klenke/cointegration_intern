The programs boot1 and boot2 written in FORTRAN 77
are programs for Monte Carlo simulations of bootstrapping
procedures for evaluating statistics for testing and 
estimating the rank in cointegrated VAR-models.

The proram boot1 computes the the empirical levels
for the bootstrap versions  of trace and lamda_max tests, 
boot2 computes the empirical probabilities for estimating
the rank as 0,1,...,r by the sequential bootstrap
procedure.

In both boot1 and boot2 the parameters of the DGP must be
specified. Also the kind of residuals/ 
estimates of the short run parameters (OLS or restricted),
and error distribuition (Gaussian, mixture of Gaussians)
must be specified.

Both boot and boot1 call the following enclosed routines:
dgpsim, errsim, dgpini, rempmat, rrest2, rrlsq1, 
berrsim, outcnt.
 
In addition the following routines from
Press, W.H., S.A. Teukolski, W.T. Vetterling and 
B.P. Flannery (1992): Numerical recipes in Fortran (2nd edn.),
Cambridge University Press are needed:
ludcmp, lubksb, choldc, gasdev, ran2, dchldc, eigsrt,
jacobi, svbksb svdcmp, pythag, balanc, elmhes, hpq
