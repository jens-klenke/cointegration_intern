\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

An issue of substantial interest in time series analysis is, whether
there exists any meaningful equilibrium relationship between two or more
time series variables. Various hypothesis tests have been suggested for
testing this so-called cointegration relationship, with the null
hypothesis of no cointegration. Their local power, however, relies
mostly on a specific nuisance parameter, namely the squared long-run
correlations of error terms driving the variables. This may lead to
inconclusive results, as one test may reject the null hypothesis, while
others accept. The detection of cointegration relationships among time
series variables is therefore complicated. Furthermore, the decision for
an applicable test poses a challenge for the practitioner.

An approach for resolving this issue might be a combination of the
different tests. Bayer and Hanck suggest a method for providing meta
tests, with high power for all forms of the nuisance parameter
\autocite{Bayerhanck2009}. Their approach is based on Fisher's
Chi-squared test \autocite{Fisher1925}. It can be shown, that this
provides an unambiguous test decision.

So far, there exists a Stata module for computing the above-mentioned
non-cointegration test. However, there is no implementation in R yet.
Therefore, the objective of this work was the development of the R
package \textbf{bayerhanck}, to implement the eponymous test. In section
2, the theoretical background of the combined non-cointegration test
will be explained further. Next, the structure of the associated R
package and its functions will be illustrated. Finally, the performance
of this approach will be evaluated.

\hypertarget{theory-of-non-cointegration-tests}{%
\section{Theory of Non-Cointegration
Tests}\label{theory-of-non-cointegration-tests}}

As mentioned above, \textcite{Bayerhanck2009} point out, that there is
no uniformly most powerful test for cointegration. This is due to the
fact, that all common tests are affected by the nuisance parameter
\(R^2\), where \(R^2\) is defined as the squared correlation of
\(\pmb{\nu}_{1t}\) with \(\nu_{2t}\).\footnote{\(R^2:= \omega_{12}^{'} \pmb{\Omega}_{11}^{-1}\omega_{12} / \omega_{22}\)}
Furthermore, \textcite{pesavento2004} has shown that for varying \(R^2\)
different tests are more powerful. Hence it is not clear which test
should be applied to the time series data.

To resolve these issues, Bayer and Hanck propose a combination of
various cointegration tests. To derive the properties of the underlying
tests and their combination, Bayer and Hanck use the following model by
\textcite{pesavento2004}:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:regressor}
\triangle \pmb{x}_t = \pmb{\tau}_1 &+  \pmb{\nu}_{1t}\\
\label{eq:y}
y_t  = \left(\mu_2 - \pmb{\theta}' \pmb{\mu}_1 \right) &+ \left(\tau_2 - \pmb{\theta}' \pmb{\tau}_1 \right)t + \pmb{\theta}' x_t + u_t \nonumber
\end{align}

where \(u_t = \rho u_{t-1} + v_{2t}\).

Equation \eqref{eq:regressor} describes the regressors, whereas equation
\eqref{eq:y} describes the possible cointgeration vector. The observed
sample can be denoted as \(\pmb{z}_0, \ldots , \pmb{z}_T\), where
\(\pmb{z}_t = (\pmb{x}_t^{'}, y_t)\).

Under the following two assumptions and \(\rho = 1\) the
\(\mathcal{H}_0\) hypothesis holds for the vector \(\pmb{z}_t\):

\begin{itemize}
  \item[] Assumption 1: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] $\{ \pmb{\nu}_t \}$ satisfied a Functional CLT, i.e. $\displaystyle T^{-1/2} \sum_{t = 1}^{[\cdot T]} \pmb{\nu}_t \Rightarrow \pmb{\Omega}^{1/2} \pmb{W}(\cdot)$, i.e $\pmb{z}_t$ is $I(1)$  
  \end{itemize}
  \item[] Assumption 2:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[] There are no cointegrated relationships among the variables in $\pmb{x}_t$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Two essential properties of this model are: firstly, the local power of
the underlying tests only depends on the parameters \(c := T(\rho -1)\)
and \(R^2\). Secondly, even asymptotically these statistics are only
weakly correlated under \(\mathcal{H}_0\). \autocite{gregory_mixed_2004}

With these central findings it may be possible to achieve a more robust
test by combining individual underlying tests. Bayer and Hanck utilise
the cointegration tests of Engel and Granger
\autocite{Englegranger1987}, Johansen \autocite{Johansen1988}, Boswijk
\autocite{Boswijk1994} and Banerjee \autocite{Banerjee1998} as their
underlying tests.

Each of these tests has a slightly different approach to testing for a
possible cointegration relationship. The Engle-Granger Test tests the
null of non cointegration against the alternative hypothesis of at least
one cointegration relationship. For this, a simple two-step procedure is
used. Firstly, the residuals \(\hat{u}_t\) of a regression of the
dependent variable on the independent variable is computed. Then, the
first differences of these residuals are regressed on the lagged
residuals. The test statistic for the Engle-Granger Test is then the
\(t\)-statistic \(t^{ADF}_\gamma\) on \(\gamma\) in the aforesaid second
regression
\(\triangle \hat{u}_t = \gamma \hat{u}_{t-1} + \sum_{p = 1}^{P-1}\nu_p \triangle \hat{u}_{t-p} +\epsilon_t\).
\autocite{Englegranger1987}

As opposed to the Engle-Granger Test, \textcite{Johansen1988}'s
cointegration test is able to test for \(h\) multiple cointegration
relationships. The null hypothesis is \(h = 0\). To implement this test,
a vector error correction model (VECM)

\begin{align}
\triangle {\bf z}_t = {\bf \Pi z}_{t-1} + \sum^{P-1}_{p=1}\pmb{\Gamma}_p \triangle{\bf z}_{t-p} + {\bf d}_t + \pmb{\epsilon}_t
\end{align}

needs to estimated first. Bayer and Hanck employ the test statstic
\(\lambda_{\max} (h) = - T \ ln(1 - \hat{\pi}_1)\), where
\(\hat{\pi}_1\) denotes the largest solution of
\(|\pi \pmb{S}_{11} - \pmb{S}_{10} \pmb{S}_{00}^{-1} \pmb{S}_{01}|= 0\).\footnote{\(\pmb{S}_{ij}\)
  denotes the moment matrices of redcued rank regression residuals.}

The cointegration tests of \textcite{Boswijk1994} and
\textcite{Banerjee1998} are based on error correction model tests.
Boswijk's test statistic \(\hat{F}\) is the Wald statistic for
\(\mathcal{H}_0: (\varphi_0, \pmb{\phi}_1^{'}) = 0\), whereas Banerjee
\emph{et al.}'s test statistic is the \(t_{\gamma}^{ECR}\) ratio for
\(\mathcal{H}_0 : \varphi_0 = 0\) of the error correction model. To
derive the error correction model, the usual least squares estimate is
used:
\(\triangle y_t = d_t + \pi_{0x}^{'} \triangle \pmb{x}_t + \varphi_0 y_{t-1} + \pmb{\varphi}_{1}^{'} \pmb{x}_{t-1} + \sum_{P = 1}^{P} \left( \pmb{\pi}_{px}^{'} \triangle \pmb{x}_{t-p} + \pi_{py} \triangle y_{t - p} \right) + \epsilon_t\).

From now on, \(t_i\) denotes the test statistic of the underlying test
\(i\). If the this test rejects for large (small) values, take
\(\xi_i := t_i (-\xi_i = t_i)\). To combine these tests into a more
powerful joint non cointegration test, Bayer and Hanck use an aggregator
employed by \textcite{Fisher1925}'s Chi-squared test. The test statistic
\(\tilde{\chi}_{\mathcal{I}}^2\) is than defined as:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:bayer-hanck}
  \tilde{\chi}_{\mathcal{I}}^{2} := -2 \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} \ln(p_i),
\end{align}

where \(\mathcal{I}\) is the index set of the \(\xi_i\).

The test statistic has the property, that the distribution under the
\(\mathcal{H}_0\) hypothesis converges to a random variable
\(\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{I}}\)
\(\left(\tilde{\chi}_{\mathcal{I}}^{2} \rightarrow_{d} \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{I}} \right)\).
This guarantees, that the statistic has a well-defined asymptotic null
distribution. According to \textcite{Bayerhanck2009}, this null
distribution is nuisance parameter free and only depends on the amount
of tests combined and the selection of tests combined. Consequently, the
joint \(\mathcal{H_0}\) hypotheses can be simulated.

Under the alternative hypotheses \(\mathcal{H}_1\) the test statistic
probability converges to
\(\tilde{\chi}_{\mathcal{I}}^{2} \rightarrow_P \infty\), which means
that the test statistic is consistent if at least one of the underlying
tests is consistent.

The package consists of four functions for the underlying tests, as well
as the function for the combined test. Furthermore, the cumulative
distribution function of the null hypothesis can be plotted. The package
features will be illustrated by using real data from the lutkepohl
dataset.

\hypertarget{implementation-of-the-underlying-tests}{%
\subsection{Implementation of the underlying
Tests}\label{implementation-of-the-underlying-tests}}

The underlying tests can be carried out by their eponymous commands,
namely \texttt{englegranger()}, \texttt{johansen()}, \texttt{banerjee()}
and \texttt{boswijk()}. The former two partly rely on already
implemented functions from the packages \textbf{urca} and
\textbf{tsDyn}. Due to the absence of associated functions for the
latter two, those had to be programmed manually. All functions take
several arguments, from which only \texttt{formula} and \texttt{data}
need to be filled out by the practitioner. Further arguments orientate
themselves on the default values defined in the Stata implementation of
the Bayer-Hanck Test. For the argument \texttt{lags}, which determines
the number of lags to be included in the model, the default value is
therefore set to 1. The argument \texttt{trend} describes the
deterministic components of the model. The practitioner may choose from
\texttt{none}, for no deterministics, \texttt{const}, for a
(unrestricted) constant and \texttt{trend}, for a (unrestricted)
constant plus (unrestricted) trend. The default value is set to
\texttt{const}. Aside from the Johansen Test, all functions where
programmed in such a way, that \texttt{trend\ =\ "none"} simply removes
the intercept from all performed linear regressions in the functions.
For \texttt{trend\ =\ "trend"} the intercept was maintained and a trend
component was added with \texttt{seq\_along()}. This generates a
sequence, which usually takes the length of the dependent variable
\(y\). For \texttt{trend\ =\ "const"} the intercept was maintained and
thus no changes were made to the linear regression formula. The trend
selection for the Johansen Test will be explained later on.

The functions of the underlying tests all return an object of classes
\texttt{co.test} and \texttt{list}. The console also returns the value
of the test statistic, as well as the name of the executed test.

In accordance with the previously explained structure, the function
\texttt{englegranger()} takes the form:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{englegranger}\NormalTok{(formula, data, }\DataTypeTok{lags =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{trend =} \StringTok{"const"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The structure of this function is orientated towards the implementation
of the Engle-Granger test in the aforesaid Stata module. Therefore, none
of the various existing functions in R is used. Firstly, a linear
regression is performed, according to the formula entered in
\texttt{englegranger()}. Next, an augmented Dickey-Fuller test is
applied to the residuals from this regression. For this, the function
\texttt{ur.df()} from the \textbf{urca} package is used. The output
value of the test statistic is then used as the test statistic of the
Engle-Granger test.

The function for the Johansen test contains the additional argument
\texttt{type}, which specifies if an maximum eigenvalue or a trace test
should be conducted. Therefore, the options are either \texttt{trace} or
\texttt{eigen}, with \texttt{eigen} being the default choice. The
structure of the function takes the form:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{johansen}\NormalTok{(formula, data, }\DataTypeTok{type =} \StringTok{"eigen"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{lags =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{trend =} \StringTok{"const"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

First of all, if the practitioner chooses \texttt{trend\ =\ "trend"}, it
has to be renamed to \texttt{"both"}. This describes the required name
for the following functions to correctly specify the requested
deterministic component. Then, the function estimates a VECM by Johansen
(MLE) method with \texttt{VECM} from the package
\textbf{tsDyn}\footnote{Compared to \texttt{ca.jo} from the
  \textbf{urca} package, the functions from \textbf{tsDyn} allow for the
  specification of an unrestricted constant and trend, which where used
  in the Stata Package for the Bayer-Hanck Test.}. A test of the
cointegrating rank is conducted. For this, the function
\texttt{rank.test()} from the same package is used. Here, the maximum
eigenvalue is used as the output test statistic of \texttt{johansen()}.

The construction of the functions for the Banerjee and Boswijk test was
almost identical. Therefore, both functions will be illustrated in a
single step. The arguments for both functions are identical to those
from \texttt{englegranger()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{banerjee}\NormalTok{(formula, data, }\DataTypeTok{lags =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{trend =} \StringTok{"const"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{boswijk}\NormalTok{(formula, data, }\DataTypeTok{lags =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{trend =} \StringTok{"const"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For the construction of these functions, first differences had to be
taken of the dependent, as well as the independent variables.
Furthermore, a matrix of the lagged values of all variables in first
differences was constructed. Then, the procedure for the Banerjee and
Boswijk test were implemented as outlined above. For calculating the
test statistics, the coefficients, as well as the covanriance-matrix
were extracted from the last linear regression model. For the Banerjee
test, the coefficient of the first regressor has to be divided by the
associated variance from the covariance-matrix. Here, one has to
consider, that the position of said values changes, when
\texttt{trend\ =\ "none"}, as the intercept is removed\footnote{Due to
  the different order in the Stata output, this could have been ignored
  there, but poses a threat in R.}.

For the test statistic of the Boswijk test, the vector of coefficients
will firstly be matrix multiplied with the inverse covariance-matrix.
Next, this product will then again be matrix multiplied with the vector
of coefficients.

\hypertarget{implementation-of-the-function-bayerhanck}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Implementation of the function
\texttt{bayerhanck()}}{Implementation of the function bayerhanck()}}\label{implementation-of-the-function-bayerhanck}}

\textcite{Bayerhanck2009}'s combined non-cointegration test can be
carried out by the command \texttt{bayerhanck()}. It accepts all of the
arguments of the previously explained underlying tests. Furthermore, it
also contains the additional arguments \texttt{test}and \texttt{crit},
which can be passed to the function call. The function thus takes the
form:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{bayerhanck}\NormalTok{(formula, data, }\DataTypeTok{lags =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{trend =} \StringTok{"const"}\NormalTok{, }
           \DataTypeTok{test =} \StringTok{"all"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{crit =} \FloatTok{0.05}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The argument \texttt{test} determines which combination of the
underlying tests should be executed. Here, the practitioner can choose
between the default \texttt{all} (performs all of the aforementioned
tests) or \texttt{eg-j}, which only carries out the Engel-Granger and
Johansen test.

The argument \texttt{crit} sets the significance level of the test. The
practitioner may choose between 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1, with the default
0.05.

After inserting the formula and the data, the selected underlying tests
are called. The test statistics of each selected test are obtained and
stored in a vector. Then, the p-values are calculated by using the
corresponding empirical null distribution. This distribution depends on
the number of variables, the trend specification and the combination of
the underlying tests. Next, the p-values are logarithmised and summed.
In accordance with equation \eqref{eq:bayer-hanck}, they are multiplied
with -2 to obtain the test statistic. In the last step, the critical
value is selected from the empirical null distribution, subject to the
specified significance level.

\texttt{bayerhanck\_1()}}{Implementation of the function bayerhanck\_1()}}\label{implementation-of-the-function-bayerhanck_1}}

The obtained values from the previously presented function
\texttt{bayerhanck()} are based on critical values provided by the
technical appendix of \textcite{Bayerhanck2009}. As an extension to this
function, the function \texttt{bayerhanck\_1()} has been developed. It
contains additional null distributions obtained from a specifically
conducted simulation. Analogous to the basic version, it takes the form:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{bayerhanck_1}\NormalTok{(formula, data, }\DataTypeTok{lags =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{trend =} \StringTok{"const"}\NormalTok{, }
           \DataTypeTok{test =} \StringTok{"all"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{crit =} \FloatTok{0.05}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The only difference is that this functioncall of the bayerhanck test
does not execute the test using the critical values we have gathered
from paper, but rather calculates the statistics with its own simulated
values. Now that we have the simulated distributions under the
\(\mathcal{H}_0\) of the Bayer hanck statistics available we are able to
calculate and print p-values.

In the current implementation of the function, we have stayed with the
initial options \texttt{eg-j} and \texttt{all} for the argument
\texttt{test}. Mainly because the amount of data is already quite large
and increases with each additional alternative test combination by about
7 MB. The main reason for this is that for each combination of
regressors and trendtype we need to have a simulated \(\mathcal{H}_0\)
distribution with, in our case, 25 000 values. In order to reduce the
amount of data and allow for further test combinations, the simulated
distribution could be reduced to 10000 values per kombination of
regressors and trendtype when the package is further developed.

At the moment, the package already has a size of about 16 MB with only
two test options. On the one hand the function needs the two null
distributions for the bayerhanck statistics and on the other hand the
null distribution of the underlying tests, which also has a size of 5
MB.

\texttt{plot()} and
\texttt{plot.bh.test()}}{Implementation of the function plot() and plot.bh.test()}}\label{implementation-of-the-function-plot-and-plot.bh.test}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(object, }\DataTypeTok{theme =} \StringTok{"dark"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{plot.bh.test}\NormalTok{(object, }\DataTypeTok{theme =} \StringTok{"dark"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In addition, we have also implemented a plot function that displays the
simulated cumulative distribution under the \(\mathcal{H}_0\) and the
Bayer-Hanck statistics. The plot function can be executed either with
the short command \texttt{plot()} or with the command
\texttt{plot.bh.test()}.

The function call needs the output object of the \texttt{bayerhanck()}
function, therefore the object must have the class \texttt{bh.test}. The
user may use the argument \texttt{theme} to choose between the option
\texttt{dark} for a dark theme or \texttt{light} for a light theme.

The command passes the Bayerhanck statistics, the number of regressors
and the trend type. Thus the function knows which null distribution
should be plotted. This data is then passed to the \texttt{ggplot2}
command and the function \texttt{ggplot::stat\_ecdf()} is used to plot
the zero distribution. Furthermore the bayerhanck statistic is indicated
with an x-intercept line.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(object)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To present the results of the Bayer-Hanck non cointegration test in a
reasonable way we have also created our own \texttt{summary()} function.

The function only needs the created object from the
\texttt{bayerhanck()} or \texttt{bayerhanck\_1()} function of the class
\texttt{bh.test}.

The function includes and displays the originally entered formula of the
VARS, the number of lags and the trend specification. Furthermore the
matrix with the test statistics and the p-values for the underlying test
is displayed. In the last third the bayerhanck statistic is displayed
with the corresponding critical value
